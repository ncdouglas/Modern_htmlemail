# modern_htmlemail

This was created following a tutorial by w3newbie on YouTube and is only meant to showcase my coding ability in regards to modern html email design. 
However, I am aware that this code would need some modification befofre being used as a live email (the images would needeto be uplaoded to the web 
before, CSS would be moved inline, and design updated for outlook).
